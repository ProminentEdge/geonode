GeoNode OpenSensorHub
=====================

This branch is home to the development of the GeoNode OpenSensorHub (OSH) contrib module. The module is verified compatible with GeoNode up to v2.6.x

The version and stability of GeoNode on this branch is not guaranteed and may conflict with other deployments. It is highly recommended to clone
this branch only to obtain the contrib module and then use it in your deployment.

GeoNode OpenSensorHub Installation
==================================

Simply copy the geonode_opensensorhub contrib folder from this project and drop it into the contrib folder in your GeoNode project then...

1. Ensure the contrib module is added to ``GEONODE_CONTRIB_APPS`` in ``geonode/settings.py``
2. Add the following to ``geonode/urls.py``::

    if "geonode.contrib.geonode_opensensorhub" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
        urlpatterns += patterns("",
                                  (r"", include("geonode.contrib.geonode_opensensorhub.urls")), )

3. Depending on your version of GeoNode, you may need to add a 'sensors' link to ``base.html`` to access ``sensors_list.html`` from the main navbar.
4. Start the application with ``paver start`` which will also generate the OSH-related models for the database.
5. If you receive any database related errors from step 4, run migrations and then restart the application.
